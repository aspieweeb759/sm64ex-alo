- If you press all panels\n\
in a level and the star\n\
doesn't spawn, then\n\
reset the ROM.\n\
- The music in some of\n\
the later levels tends to\n\
break after a while, an\n\
AziAudio audio plugin\n\
can fix that.\n\
Another way to fix the\n\
music issue is to simply\n\
exit course and to\n\
reenter the level."))
